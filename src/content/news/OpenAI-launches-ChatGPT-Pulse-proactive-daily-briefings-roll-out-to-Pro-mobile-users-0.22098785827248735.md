# OpenAI launches ChatGPT Pulse: proactive daily briefings roll out to Pro mobile users

OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Pulse, a new mode that proactively delivers personalized daily briefings instead of waiting for a prompt. The feature is in preview for Pro users on iOS and Android and marks a push toward more agentic assistants. 

## The Breakthrough/Achievement
- Once per day, Pulse compiles visual update cards from overnight, asynchronous research. 
- Personalization draws on chat history, saved memory, feedback, and optional connectors. 
- Initial access: Pro subscribers on mobile; OpenAI plans to expand to Plus after early feedback. 
- Safety checks filter topics that violate policies to keep updates focused and appropriate. 

## Technical Details
- Inputs: chat history, user “memory,” and thumbs‑up/down feedback to refine future editions. 
- Connectors: optional Gmail and Google Calendar integrations add context (off by default, toggleable in settings). 
- Delivery: visual summaries refreshed daily; users can expand, ask follow‑ups, or save items as chats. 
- Platforms and availability: early preview on iOS and Android for Pro; documented in the ChatGPT release notes. 

## Impact/Applications
- Shifts ChatGPT from reactive Q&A to a proactive assistant that surfaces next steps for goals like trip planning, training plans, or meeting prep. 
- Competes with broader “AI agent” efforts from tech giants by packaging timely, context‑aware updates without endless scrolling. 
- For busy users, a single morning digest could reduce app‑hopping across email, calendar, and search for routine planning. 

## Future Outlook
- OpenAI says Pulse will add more app connections and deliver updates at key moments (for example, before meetings), with broader plan availability “after” the Pro preview. 
- Expect iterative tuning over the coming weeks as OpenAI collects feedback to improve relevance and timing. 

Closing Paragraph
ChatGPT Pulse is a modest but meaningful step toward everyday, proactive AI assistance: a once‑a‑day, curated snapshot that uses your context to suggest what matters next. If early testing goes well, expanding beyond Pro mobile users could make Pulse a default morning check‑in for millions.
