# Apple moves toward foldable iPhone with Taiwan pilot line for 2026

Apple is taking concrete steps toward a long-rumored foldable iPhone, exploring a pilot manufacturing line in Taiwan to validate processes before scaling in India for a targeted 2026 release, according to a Nikkei-sourced report. Apple declined to comment.

## The Breakthrough

- Apple is in talks with suppliers to establish a “mini pilot line” in northern Taiwan to fine-tune foldable iPhone manufacturing.  
- If successful, the process would be replicated in India for mass production.  
- The 2026 iPhone lineup target is about 95 million units, over 10% higher than 2025—new form factors are seen as key to hitting that goal.  
- The move follows Apple’s September hardware event that introduced a thinner iPhone Air alongside updated models.

## Technical Details

- A Taiwan-based pilot will be used for equipment testing and to lock in parameters for folding mechanisms and yields.  
- Suppliers have identified a potential site in northern Taiwan to support early engineering runs.  
- After validation, Apple intends to shift volume manufacturing to India to scale output.  
- Apple offered no immediate public comment on the report.

## Impact/Applications

- A foldable iPhone would mark Apple’s entry into a maturing category dominated by Samsung and others, potentially catalyzing broader consumer adoption. The 2026 timeline positions Apple to align the foldable with its next major iPhone cycle.  
- The Taiwan-to-India pathway underscores Apple’s ongoing supply-chain diversification and manufacturing expansion beyond China.

## Future Outlook

- Recent supply-chain reporting suggests Apple’s foldable program is advancing through prototyping now with a second-half 2026 launch window, consistent with the new pilot-line push.  
- Watch for engineering validation through 2025, with a clearer read on panel supply and hinge durability as pilot data emerges.

In short, Apple appears to be moving from concept to on-the-line testing for a foldable iPhone. If the Taiwan pilot proceeds smoothly and India ramp plans hold, 2026 could be the year Apple’s first foldable joins the flagship lineup—potentially lifting overall shipments and reshaping premium phone design trends.
