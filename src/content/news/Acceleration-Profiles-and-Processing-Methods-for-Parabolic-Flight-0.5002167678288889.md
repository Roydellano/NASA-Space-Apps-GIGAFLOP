# Introduction
Parabolic flights are a cornerstone of space bioscience research, offering brief but valuable periods of reduced gravity that simulate the conditions of spaceflight. They serve as a cost-effective platform for testing hardware, training astronauts, and conducting foundational scientific experiments. However, a lack of standardized methods for collecting and analyzing the acceleration data from these flights has made it difficult to compare results across studies. This publication addresses this gap by presenting a complete, open-source solution for precisely characterizing the gravito-inertial environment of parabolic flights.

## Research Objective
The primary goal was to develop and validate a robust, accessible, and reproducible methodology for analyzing parabolic flight acceleration data. The specific objectives were to:
-   Develop an orientation-independent data processing pipeline that can automatically classify all phases of flight.
-   Validate the method using a commercially available, low-mass accelerometer during a real parabolic flight campaign.
-   Make all data and analysis code publicly available to foster standardization and improve the quality of future parabolic flight research.

## Key Findings
The study successfully demonstrated a novel method for characterizing the variable gravity environments achieved during parabolic flight.
-   The analysis pipeline, using a **two-stage change-point detection algorithm**, automatically and accurately segmented the flight into distinct phases: parabola, hypergravity, and level flight transitions.
-   The system precisely quantified the g-levels achieved during the 20 parabolas. The average g-level for **0-g parabolas was 0.041 ± 0.005 g**.
-   Specific reduced-gravity parabolas were also accurately measured, achieving **0.159 g for a lunar simulation** and **0.356 g for two Mars simulations**.
-   The duration of the reduced-gravity phases was determined to be **19.5 ± 1.4 s** for 0-g parabolas, **23.7 s** for the lunar parabola, and **28.9 ± 0.7 s** for the Mars parabolas.
-   The hardware solution, a **Slam Stick X™ accelerometer**, was proven to be a compact (65 g), low-power, and high-resolution tool ideal for monitoring the local acceleration environment within an experiment.

## Methodology
-   **Organisms/Subjects:** The study focused on characterizing the physical environment aboard a **Boeing 727-200F aircraft**, not on a biological organism.
-   **Experimental Conditions:** Data was collected during a single flight with **20 parabolas**, which included targeted 0-g, lunar-g (0.17 g), and Mars-g (0.38 g) profiles.
-   **Key Techniques:** Acceleration was recorded using a commercial Slam Stick X™ accelerometer. The core of the analysis is an **orientation-independent algorithm** that calculates the Euclidean norm of the three acceleration axes. This data was then filtered and processed using a **change-point detection method** to automatically identify and classify periods of stable and transitioning g-levels.

## Importance for Space Missions
This work provides a critical tool for improving the quality and reliability of research conducted in spaceflight analogs.
-   **Enhanced Research Quality:** By providing a standard for measuring and reporting the g-environment, this method allows for more accurate correlation between biological or physical changes and the precise g-levels experienced, increasing the scientific rigor of parabolic flight studies.
-   **Improved Mission Preparedness:** Parabolic flights are used to test technologies and protocols for missions to the ISS, the Moon, and Mars. A standardized analysis approach ensures that data from these test flights are consistent and comparable, leading to better-designed experiments and hardware for actual space missions.
-   **Accessibility and Reproducibility:** Making the hardware solution, data, and code open-source lowers the barrier for researchers to conduct high-quality, reproducible experiments, ultimately accelerating the pace of discovery in space biosciences.

## Knowledge Gaps & Future Research
While this study provides a strong foundation, it also highlights areas for future work.
-   The methodology needs to be validated across a wider variety of parabolic flight campaigns, aircraft, and flight providers to ensure its universal applicability.
-   The processing algorithms could be adapted and tested for other microgravity simulation platforms, such as suborbital flights and drop towers.
-   A community-wide, data-driven consensus is needed to define "high-quality" microgravity in terms of stability and duration, which this method can help establish.
-   Future research should focus on integrating this local acceleration data directly with experimental payloads to enable real-time event triggering or data correction based on g-level fluctuations.

## Results
This study delivers a significant advancement for the space biosciences community by providing a validated, open-source, and accessible framework for analyzing parabolic flight data. By standardizing how the microgravity environment is measured and reported, this work enhances the scientific value of parabolic flights as a crucial analog for space exploration, ensuring that ground-based research more effectively supports the goals of long-duration human missions.
