# ExpressVPN launches EventVPN: a free, ad‑supported VPN built on its premium network

ExpressVPN this week rolled out EventVPN, a free VPN service that promises unlimited bandwidth, a strict no-logs policy, and premium-grade infrastructure—funded by a privacy-first ad model. Early coverage highlights that the launch targets the risky state of “free VPNs” by offering a no-cost alternative with security guarantees. 

## What’s new
- Built on ExpressVPN’s audited, RAM-only network with a **10 Gbps** backbone and **ChaCha20‑Poly1305** encryption.   
- Free tier supports one device across **35+ locations**; Premium lifts ads, expands to **125+ locations** and up to **8 devices** for **$69.99/year**.   
- Uses Apple’s **ATT/IDFA** for ad delivery, keeping advertising isolated from VPN infrastructure.   
- Available now on **iOS and macOS**; broader platform support may follow. 

## Under the hood
- Anonymous access via Apple account validation and receipt checks—no backend user database; sessions issued with **connection tokens**.   
- Security stack includes a **Kill Switch**, **no‑logs policy**, and **RAM‑only servers** that wipe on reboot.   
- Network protocol leverages ExpressVPN’s **post‑quantum WireGuard** implementation. 

## Why it matters
- The free VPN market is crowded with **data‑harvesting or low‑quality apps**; EventVPN’s model aims to deliver a safer no‑cost option without data caps.   
- For privacy-conscious users on Apple devices, this offers a **no‑fee on‑ramp** to stronger protection compared to typical freemium caps or throttles. 

## What’s next
- ExpressVPN signaled possible expansion beyond Apple; Android and Linux builds are “on the table.” Watch for **regional rollouts** and independent audits confirming claims around ads/data separation.   
- Competitive pressure may push rival providers to revisit free tiers and adopt similar **privacy‑preserving ad models**. 

Closing thought: EventVPN won’t replace a full-featured paid VPN for power users, but blending a free tier with verifiable privacy engineering could raise the bar for no‑cost security tools—especially if third‑party audits corroborate ExpressVPN’s architecture and policies over the coming months.
