# Oracle releases Java 25 with long‑term support, AI and security upgrades

Oracle has officially shipped Java 25 (Oracle JDK 25), marking the platform’s latest long‑term support (LTS) release with a focus on AI performance, modern language ergonomics, and stronger security primitives. The company says Java 25 includes 18 JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs) and will receive at least eight years of support.

## What’s new in Java 25
- Long‑term support: quarterly security updates through September 2028, with additional updates planned through at least September 2033.  
- 18 JEPs delivered across language, libraries, and tooling, including improvements that target AI inference and high‑throughput services.  
- Emphasis on developer productivity via simplified imports and more expressive patterns.  
- Continued six‑month release cadence to accelerate incremental innovation.

## Technical details
- Language features: Primitive type pattern matching (JEP 507) and Module Import Declarations (JEP 511) streamline code and reduce boilerplate.  
- Concurrency and performance: Structured Concurrency (JEP 505) and Scoped Values (JEP 506) aim to make multithreaded code more reliable—useful for parallel AI workloads. Vector API, 10th Incubator (JEP 508) targets faster data‑parallel operations.  
- Security: New PEM encoding API (JEP 470) and a Key Derivation Function API (JEP 510) strengthen cryptographic hygiene and support a path toward hybrid, quantum‑safe schemes.  
- Observability: JFR Method Timing & Tracing (JEP 520) expands low‑overhead profiling for pinpointing bottlenecks in production.

## Impact and applications
- Enterprises that standardize on LTS releases (8, 11, 17, 21) now have a modern baseline designed for AI‑infused apps, microservices, and secure data pipelines.  
- Oracle highlights additional gains when running Java 25 on OCI, including performance and cost efficiencies for large deployments.

## What’s next
- Java 25 begins the typical enterprise rollout cycle over the coming quarters as teams validate compatibility and performance; Oracle will issue quarterly updates on the LTS track. The OpenJDK roadmap includes items such as Generational Shenandoah GC (JEP 521) already integrated for this release.

In short, Java 25 modernizes the LTS baseline with tangible wins for performance, security, and developer velocity—positioning the platform to power the next wave of AI‑driven, cloud‑native applications.
