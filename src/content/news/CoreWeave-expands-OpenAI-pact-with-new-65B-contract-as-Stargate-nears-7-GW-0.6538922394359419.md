# CoreWeave expands OpenAI pact with new $6.5B contract as ‘Stargate’ nears 7 GW

CoreWeave has signed a new contract with OpenAI worth up to $6.5 billion, bringing the pair’s 2025 deal value to **$22.4 billion**. The move accelerates OpenAI’s “Stargate” buildout and signals unrelenting demand for AI compute. 

## What’s new
- New agreement: **$6.5B** more in GPU cloud capacity for OpenAI.
- 2025 total: Three CoreWeave-OpenAI deals now sum to **$22.4B** (March: $11.9B; May: $4B; September: $6.5B).  
- Stargate expansion: With newly announced sites via Oracle and SoftBank, planned capacity approaches **~7 GW**.  
- CoreWeave positioning: CEO Michael Intrator calls this “the quarter of diversification,” as revenue mix expands beyond prior concentration. 

## Under the hood
- OpenAI’s infrastructure target: at least **10 GW** of NVIDIA systems over multiple years.  
- NVIDIA intends to invest up to **$100B** in OpenAI, with first deployments slated on the next‑gen **Vera Rubin** platform in 2H **2026**.  
- CoreWeave recently placed an initial **$6.3B** hardware order with NVIDIA; any unused capacity has a buyback provision. 

## Why it matters
- For AI builders: More capacity to train and serve frontier models, potentially easing current compute bottlenecks.  
- For the market: Reinforces NVIDIA’s role across the stack (chips, systems, and strategic investment) while intensifying scrutiny of “circular” funding across AI infrastructure players.  
- For cloud ecosystems: Signals OpenAI’s multi‑partner strategy alongside Microsoft, Oracle, SoftBank, and CoreWeave. 

## What’s next
- Timeline: First gigawatt under the NVIDIA-OpenAI partnership targets online in the **second half of 2026**.  
- Watchpoints: Regulatory and antitrust attention on deep, intertwined supplier-customer investments; potential power and siting constraints as capacity scales toward **10 GW**. 

In short, the latest CoreWeave-OpenAI contract is a pragmatic scale-up—less splashy than a new model launch, but pivotal to delivering the compute backbone that next‑gen AI systems will require over the next 12–24 months.
