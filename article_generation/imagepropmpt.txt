--seed [number]: Ensure consistency across generations
--v 5.2: Use the latest model version

Important Notes for NASA Bioscience Imagery

Text in Image
Keep it short and scientifically relevant (10-20 characters)
Use NASA-style typography (clean sans-serif fonts like "Helvetica Neue" or "DIN")
Integrate naturally into scientific equipment displays, monitors, or AR overlays
Match research topic (e.g., "Bone Density", "Cell Growth", "Radiation Effects")

Composition
Follow the rule of thirds with scientific focal points
Ensure clear focus on biological/medical elements
Balance text with scientific imagery (microscopy, data visualizations, equipment)
Include NASA/ISS environmental context when appropriate

Color Palette for Space Biology
ISS Interior: White, gray, blue accents, metallic surfaces
Laboratory: Clean whites, clinical blues, neutral tones
Biological Elements: Natural colors (greens for plants, reds/blues for cells)
Data Displays: High-tech blues, cyans, and holographic effects
Space Context: Deep blacks, Earth blues, warm ISS lighting

Technical Details
Always use high resolution (8k) for scientific detail
Ensure clean laboratory or ISS module lighting
Optimize for sharpness to show cellular/biological details
Include subtle NASA branding aesthetic (clean, modern, precise)

Research Category Visual Themes
Human Physiology: Medical equipment, body scans, astronaut health monitoring
Microgravity Effects: Floating objects, ISS modules, cellular changes
Radiation Biology: DNA structures, protective equipment, deep space imagery
Plant Biology: Growth chambers, LED lights, green foliage, closed ecosystems
Cell/Molecular: Microscopy, protein structures, gene visualization
Musculoskeletal: Bone scans, exercise equipment, skeletal imagery
Cardiovascular: Heart monitoring, blood flow visualization, medical sensors
Neurology: Brain scans, neural networks, cognitive testing

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Generic stock photo aesthetics (aim for authentic NASA/ISS environment)
Overly colorful or "sci-fi fantasy" style (maintain scientific realism)
Missing biological/medical elements central to space biology
Failing to incorporate ISS or laboratory context
Omitting key technical parameters for scientific detail
Text that doesn't relate to the research topic
